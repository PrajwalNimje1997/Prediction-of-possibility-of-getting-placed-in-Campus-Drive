# Prediction-of-possibility-of-getting-placed-in-Campus-Drive
In this project, I have predicted :
1. the possibility of students for getting placed in the campus drive.
2. the parameters which contributes more for getting placed.
    
The Machine learning is trained on:
1. Logistic Regression.
2. Naive Bayes.
3. Bernoullis Naive Bayes.
4. SVM
    
Conclusion: It is found that the highest accuracy is obtained with Logistic Regression. The accuracy obtained is 81%.
